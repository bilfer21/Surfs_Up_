# Oahu Temperature Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to summarize observed temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine compatibility with the proposed surf shop/ice cream business. The temperature data was collected over several years, placed into a SQLite database, and analyzed using Python queries.

## Summary

One way to further refne this analysis would be to isolate the analysis to data gathered from station in the nearest proximity to the proposed placement of the business.
